## What I learned
* I learned about GitHub abd R which I wasn't familiar with before. I learned how to start a pull request and what a repository is.
* I am new to GitHub and R, so this was a bit challenging to understand, however the instructions were pretty easy to follow. 

## Record all the steps used to process data (Wilson et al.) 
* If you don't do this then it is impossible for someone to replicate your data. They suggest to write script for every stage of data processing. 
* Another suggestion is to use data-cleaning tools like OpenRefine. If not available then you have to do document every manual action.
