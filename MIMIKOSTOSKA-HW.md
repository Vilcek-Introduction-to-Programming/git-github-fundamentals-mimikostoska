## What I learned
* I learned about GitHub and R which I wasn't familiar with before. I learned how to start a pull request and what a repository is.
* I am new to GitHub and R, so this is a bit challenging to understand, however I know that it might take time to get used to it. 

## Record all the steps used to process data (Wilson et al.) 
* If you don't do this then it is impossible for someone to replicate your data. They suggest to write script for every stage of data processing. 
* Another suggestion is to use data-cleaning tools like OpenRefine. If not available then you have to do document every manual action.  
* Tools like R or GitHub can help because you can easily retrace your steps and go over the code. 

* I put the line in R. 

## GM Feedback
* Nice use of markdown synatax! (e.g., headings and lists) https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/
* I'm so glad you mentioned OpenRefine, I love that software and it's useful for exploring and cleaning data. It also contributes to reproducibility because you can export all your data cleaning steps into a JSON file and you can apply those steps to other data sets (or add it to your data documention:  https://openrefine.org/
